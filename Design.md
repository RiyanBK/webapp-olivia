### Functionality

#### Core Features

1. **Multiple Room System**
   - **Personal Rooms**: Private spaces for individual decor, journaling, and self-expression.
         - //RBK: are other users able to access/view these private spaces? could there be multiple friend levels (ex. friend, best friend, close friend) to determine what friends' rooms users are able to access?
   - **Shared Living Room**: Common area for group hangouts, collaborative decorating, and shared media.
   - **Study Room**: Quiet space for journaling, reading shared entries, and adding memories to the Bookshelf.
   - **Gaming Room**: Room dedicated to playing simple minigames with friends.

2. **Room Customization**
   - Users can collaboratively customize shared rooms and personalize private rooms with furniture, decor, wallpaper, and themes.
         - //RBK: what determines whether users' friends can edit the users' rooms?

3. **Media Interaction**
   - Shared screens in the Living Room enable users to watch movies, YouTube videos, and listen to music together in real-time.

4. **Creative Canvas**
   - An interactive drawing board in each room, especially the Study Room, allows users to doodle, create art, and add to a shared gallery.

5. **Bookshelf for Keepsake Entries**
   - A virtual Bookshelf in the Study Room lets users store and browse multimedia journal entries.

6. **Bulletin Board for Quick Updates**
   - A Bulletin Board in the Living Room is available for posting quick updates (photos, notes, or recordings) with reaction options like stickers, comments, and voice notes. Each post can feature icons for mood, weather, or location.

7. **Mailbox with Notifications**
   - Users can send multimedia messages privately or to the group, with notifications to keep them updated on new messages.

         - //RBK: how do users friend each other? is there a friend code, link, or other function to make friends? can users play with random people online?
         - //RBK: how do users navigate between rooms?

### User Flow

1. **Start Screen**
   - Options include Login, Choose Room, and Settings, along with a brief overview of room features, navigation, and core interactions.

2. **Room Navigation**
   - Users choose which room to enter: Personal Room, Living Room, Study Room, or Gaming Room. Room themes and decor reflect each room’s purpose.
         - //RBK: do users need to navigate back out to the start screen in order to navigate between rooms? is there a prominent button on the play screen that users can click to do room navigation? can users click on doors between rooms to go between them?

3. **Interactive Elements**
   - Users can interact with various room features, such as watching media in the Living Room, browsing the Bulletin Board for updates, or journaling in the Study Room. Minigames in the Gaming Room allow for solo or group play, with quick leaderboard-style scores to encourage friendly competition.

### Aesthetics

1. **Visual Style**
   - The theme is cozy and slightly vintage to give a nostalgic feel across multiple rooms. Each room has a distinct theme: the Living Room is cozy, the Study Room is library-like, and the Gaming Room is lively. The Bulletin Board resembles a virtual corkboard with “snapshots” of posts.
         - //RBK: what do posts look like? how do users create new posts?

2. **Color Scheme**
   - The palette features warm, soft colors with specific accent colors in each room: soft greens and browns in the Living Room, deep blue and dark wood tones in the Study Room, and playful colors in the Gaming Room.
        - //RBK: are "playful colors" neon/techno?
 
3. **Typography**
   - Font styles are simple and rounded for a cozy feel, with handwritten fonts for personal entries to enhance readability across interactive elements and labels.
         - //RBK: what handwritten typeset will be used? will it be a readable one or created one?

4. **Layout**

   - **Screen Arrangement**: The main area occupies most of the screen, providing easy access to interactive elements and decor options. The HUD (Heads-Up Display) includes a Notification Center with small icons showing updates for each room and a Navigation Bar with easy-access icons to switch between rooms.
         - //RBK: are interactive game elements and decor options free to the user? is this a completely creative space, or are there playtime or achievement requirements to attain certain decor options?

   - **Navigation**: Clear start and end screens feature large, accessible buttons for a smooth user experience.
